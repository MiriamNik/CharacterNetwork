## Overview
This project analyzes a network of relationships between different characters. The network is constructed from a dataset with nodes representing characters and edges representing relationships.

### Key Features:
- **PageRank Analysis**: Determines the most important nodes in the network.
- **Community Detection**: Identifies densely connected sub-networks using the Louvain Method.
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures how closely nodes are interconnected within their neighborhoods.
For detailed analysis, please see the Analysis Document.
