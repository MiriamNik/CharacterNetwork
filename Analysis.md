# Detailed Network Analysis

This document explains the network analysis conducted in this project. Below are the key findings and explanations for the analysis:

## PageRank Analysis
The PageRank algorithm was used to determine the most central nodes in the network. As seen in the PageRank visualization, certain nodes have significantly higher importance. These nodes likely represent central characters in the network with strong connections to others.

## Community Detection
Using the Louvain method, we detected **X** communities within the network. Nodes within the same community are densely connected, indicating that they form a cohesive sub-network. The visualization colors these communities distinctly.

## Clustering Coefficient
The clustering coefficient measures how connected a node's neighbors are to each other. Nodes with a high clustering coefficient tend to be part of tightly-knit communities, while nodes with a low coefficient are more isolated.
